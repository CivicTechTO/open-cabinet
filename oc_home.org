* Glossary
+ *Orders-in-council*, also known as governor-in-council decisions, are cabinet decisions that can be made without having to go to Parliament. They can cover anything from minor appointments, regulatory changes and housekeeping items to major decisions such as authorizing the signing of a treaty, weapons sales and questions of national defence or national security.

+ Under the [[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-22/page-1.html][Statutory Instruments Act]], a government can choose not to publish an order-in-council if its “publication could reasonably be expected to be injurious” to federal-provincial affairs, the conduct of international affairs, “the defence of Canada or any state allied or associated with Canada” or the “detection, prevention or suppression of subversive or hostile activities.”
